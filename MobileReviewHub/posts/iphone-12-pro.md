# iPhone 12 Pro: Premium Performance with Pro Photography Tools

The iPhone 12 Pro marks a significant redesign in Apple's smartphone lineup, combining powerful new camera capabilities, 5G connectivity, and the A14 Bionic chip in a premium package with flat edges reminiscent of the iPhone 4/5 era.

## Design & Build Quality

The iPhone 12 Pro features a complete redesign from its predecessor with flat stainless steel sides and a matte glass back. Available in Graphite, Silver, Gold, and the new Pacific Blue, the device offers a premium and distinctive aesthetic that balances modern and classic design elements.

Despite having a larger 6.1-inch display than the 5.8-inch screen of the iPhone 11 Pro, the 12 Pro maintains a similar physical footprint thanks to reduced bezels. At 187g, it's slightly heavier than its predecessor due to the stainless steel frame and new internal components.

The build quality is exceptional with surgical-grade stainless steel for the frame and Ceramic Shield front glass that Apple claims offers 4x better drop protection than previous iPhones. With IP68 water and dust resistance, the device can withstand submersion in 6 meters of water for up to 30 minutes.

## Display

The 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED display offers a resolution of 2532 x 1170 pixels at 460 ppi. Key display features include:

- 1200 nits peak brightness for HDR content
- True Tone technology for adaptive color temperature
- P3 wide color gamut with excellent color accuracy
- HDR10 and Dolby Vision support

Despite the premium positioning, the iPhone 12 Pro does not include a high refresh rate display, remaining at the standard 60Hz when many Android competitors at similar price points offered 90Hz or 120Hz panels. Despite this limitation, the display quality is excellent, with deep blacks, vibrant colors, and high brightness that ensures good visibility even in direct sunlight.

## Performance

Powered by the A14 Bionic chip built on a 5nm process, the iPhone 12 Pro delivers exceptional performance for all tasks. The 6-core CPU and 4-core GPU handle everything from everyday apps to demanding games with ease, while the 16-core Neural Engine enables advanced computational photography and machine learning features.

With 6GB of RAM (up from 4GB in the standard iPhone 12 models), the device maintains smooth multitasking performance even with demanding applications. The A14 established Apple's lead in mobile processor performance, particularly in single-core tasks, which remained unmatched by Android competitors at the time.

## Camera System

The camera system receives several notable upgrades over the iPhone 11 Pro:

- A 12MP main camera with a larger sensor, faster f/1.6 aperture, and improved OIS
- 12MP ultrawide camera with a 120-degree field of view and improved low-light capabilities
- 12MP telephoto camera with 2x optical zoom
- 12MP TrueDepth front camera with improved Night mode support

A standout addition is the LiDAR Scanner, previously only available on the iPad Pro, which enables:
- Faster autofocus in low light (up to 6x faster)
- Night mode portraits with accurate depth mapping
- Enhanced AR experiences with precise depth information

The camera system also introduces:
- Apple ProRAW for professional-level editing flexibility (added in iOS 14.3)
- Night mode now available on all cameras
- Dolby Vision HDR video recording at up to 60fps
- Smart HDR 3 for better handling of challenging lighting scenarios

These features establish the iPhone 12 Pro as an excellent camera phone, particularly for those interested in computational photography and video recording.

## 5G and Connectivity

The iPhone 12 series marks Apple's entry into 5G, with the Pro supporting both sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G in the US (models in other regions typically support only sub-6GHz). This enables significantly faster data speeds in areas with 5G coverage, though the actual benefit varied widely depending on carrier and location.

Other connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.0, Ultra Wideband for precise spatial awareness, and NFC with reader mode for Apple Pay and other contactless interactions.

## iOS 14 Features

The iPhone 12 Pro launched with iOS 14, which introduced several notable features:

- Home screen widgets for at-a-glance information
- App Library for better organization
- Picture-in-picture video
- Compact call interface
- App Clips for using parts of apps without installation
- Enhanced privacy features

The software experience remains a highlight, with the promise of long-term updates and tight integration with other Apple devices and services.

## Battery Life

The 2815mAh battery typically provides a full day of moderate use, though heavy users may need a top-up before the day ends. Apple claimed up to 17 hours of video playback and up to 65 hours of audio playback.

Charging options include:

- 20W wired charging via Lightning (reaching about 50% in 30 minutes)
- 15W MagSafe wireless charging, a new magnetic system introduced with the iPhone 12 series
- 7.5W Qi wireless charging

Controversially, Apple removed the charger and EarPods from the box, citing environmental reasons, providing only a USB-C to Lightning cable.

## Verdict

The iPhone 12 Pro represents a significant upgrade over its predecessor, with an attractive new design, improved camera capabilities, 5G connectivity, and the powerful A14 Bionic chip. The addition of the LiDAR Scanner and Dolby Vision HDR video recording provides creative tools that appeal particularly to photography and videography enthusiasts.

While the lack of a high refresh rate display is disappointing at this premium price point, and battery life is merely adequate rather than exceptional, the overall package delivers an excellent experience for users in Apple's ecosystem.

For users deciding between the standard iPhone 12 and the 12 Pro, the key differentiators are the additional telephoto camera, LiDAR Scanner, brighter maximum display output, stainless steel frame (versus aluminum), and increased RAM and storage options, which may or may not justify the price premium depending on individual needs and priorities.
