# Motorola Edge 40 Pro: Flagship Performance with Lightning-Fast Charging

The Motorola Edge 40 Pro represents the company's flagship offering for 2023, delivering top-tier specifications and features at a price point that undercuts many premium competitors. It combines powerful performance, a versatile camera system, and exceptionally fast charging in a sleek, premium package.

## Design & Build Quality

The Edge 40 Pro features a refined design with a curved display and back panel that flow smoothly into an aluminum frame. Available in Interstellar Black and Lunar Blue, the device offers a premium look and feel with a clean, minimalist aesthetic.

With dimensions of 161.2 x 74 x 8.6mm and weighing 199g, the phone strikes a good balance between screen size and manageability. The build quality is excellent with Gorilla Glass Victus protection on both front and back, providing good resistance to scratches and drops.

The device carries an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, allowing for submersion in up to 1.5 meters of freshwater for 30 minutes. This robust protection represents an improvement over previous Motorola flagships and brings it in line with other premium devices.

## Display

The 6.67-inch pOLED display is a highlight feature, offering:

- FHD+ resolution (2400 x 1080 pixels) at 394 ppi
- 165Hz refresh rate for ultra-smooth scrolling and animations
- 360Hz touch sampling rate for responsive touch input
- HDR10+ certification with up to 1300 nits peak brightness
- 10-bit color depth for over 1 billion colors

The display wraps around the edges with a pronounced curve that enhances the premium look and reduces the perceived bezel size, though it can occasionally lead to accidental touches. The high refresh rate provides a noticeably smoother experience when navigating the UI, while the vibrant colors and deep blacks make for an excellent media consumption experience.

## Performance

Powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, the Edge 40 Pro delivers flagship-level performance for all tasks. The chipset is paired with 12GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 256GB or 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage (though without expansion options), ensuring smooth multitasking and quick app loading times.

The thermal management system handles the powerful chipset well, preventing significant throttling during extended gaming sessions or intensive tasks. Benchmark results place the Edge 40 Pro among the top-performing Android devices of its generation, competing effectively with more expensive flagships.

Motorola's approach to Android is relatively lightweight, with minimal bloatware and a near-stock experience enhanced with thoughtful additions. This lean software approach contributes to the device's snappy, responsive feel in everyday use.

## Camera System

The versatile triple camera system includes:

- 50MP main camera with OIS, using a 1/1.55" sensor
- 50MP ultrawide camera with macro capabilities and a 114° field of view
- 12MP telephoto camera with 2x optical zoom
- 60MP front camera for high-resolution selfies

Camera performance is generally good, particularly from the main sensor in well-lit conditions, producing detailed images with natural colors and good dynamic range. The ultrawide camera maintains similar color science to the main shooter, while the 2x telephoto provides useful zoom flexibility.

Low-light performance has improved over previous Motorola flagships but still lags behind the best camera phones on the market. The ultrawide camera, in particular, struggles in challenging lighting conditions.

Video capabilities include 8K recording at 30fps and 4K at up to 60fps, with good stabilization and detail retention. The addition of HDR10+ video recording enhances dynamic range in high-contrast scenes.

## Battery & Charging

The 4600mAh battery typically provides a full day of moderate use, though heavy users may need a top-up before the day ends. While battery capacity is adequate, endurance is merely average compared to some competitors with similar battery sizes, likely due to the high refresh rate display and powerful processor.

The standout feature is the charging system:

- 125W TurboPower wired charging (reaching a full charge in just 23 minutes)
- 15W wireless charging
- 5W reverse wireless charging for accessories

The incredibly fast wired charging largely compensates for the average battery life, allowing users to quickly replenish the battery when needed. The included 125W charger in the box is also a welcome addition when many manufacturers have stopped including chargers.

## Software

The Edge 40 Pro runs Android 13 with Motorola's lightweight My UX overlay, which preserves the clean Android experience while adding useful features like:

- Moto Actions for gesture controls (chop for flashlight, twist for camera)
- Ready For platform for desktop-like experience when connected to a display
- Personalization options for colors, fonts, and icon shapes
- ThinkShield security suite for enhanced protection

Motorola promises three years of major OS updates and four years of security patches, which is an improvement over their previous commitments but still falls short of Samsung and Google's longer update promises.

## Additional Features

Other notable features include:

- Stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support for immersive audio
- Three microphones for improved noise cancellation during calls
- Full 5G support across various bands
- Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 for fast wireless connectivity
- In-display fingerprint sensor for secure biometric authentication

## Verdict

The Motorola Edge 40 Pro successfully delivers a flagship experience at a more competitive price point than many premium alternatives. Its strengths lie in the exceptional performance, incredibly fast charging, smooth display, and clean software experience.

While the camera system doesn't quite match the best in class (particularly in challenging lighting conditions) and the battery life is merely average despite the rapid charging, the overall package offers excellent value for those seeking a premium Android experience without the highest-tier price tag.

For users who prioritize performance, display quality, and charging speed over absolute camera superiority, the Edge 40 Pro represents a compelling option in the upper-midrange flagship segment. The addition of proper water resistance and improved update commitment also addresses some of the traditional weak points of Motorola's premium offerings.
