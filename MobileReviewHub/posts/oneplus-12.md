# OnePlus 12: Refined Performance Flagship

The OnePlus 12 continues the brand's evolution as a premium smartphone manufacturer, combining high-end specifications with thoughtful refinements to create a compelling flagship experience.

## Design & Build Quality

The OnePlus 12 features a sophisticated design with a circular camera module that blends smoothly into the curved back panel. Available in Flowy Emerald, Silky Black, and Glacial White, the device offers distinctive color options with unique textures. The Flowy Emerald variant is particularly notable for its marble-like pattern that creates a striking visual effect.

The device features a metal frame and glass back with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protection. With IP65 water and dust resistance (IP68 in some regions), it offers good protection against environmental hazards, though the IP65 rating in certain markets falls short of the comprehensive water resistance offered by some competitors.

The iconic Alert Slider returns, positioned on the left side for easy access. This hardware switch for toggling notification profiles remains a distinctive feature of OnePlus devices that adds genuine utility to everyday use.

## Display

The 6.82-inch LTPO AMOLED display with 3168 x 1440 resolution represents one of the best screens available on any smartphone. With an adaptive refresh rate from 1Hz to 120Hz, it balances smoothness with power efficiency. The panel reaches a peak brightness of 4500 nits, ensuring excellent visibility even in direct sunlight.

Developed in partnership with BOE, the display supports 10-bit color depth, 100% DCI-P3 coverage, HDR10+, and Dolby Vision. The slight curve along the edges helps minimize bezels while providing a premium look and feel.

## Performance

Powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, the OnePlus 12 delivers top-tier performance for all tasks. With configurations offering up to 24GB of RAM in some markets (though typically maxing at 16GB in most regions), the device excels at multitasking and demanding applications.

OnePlus has implemented an advanced cooling system with a large vapor chamber to manage thermals during intensive gaming sessions. This helps maintain consistent performance without the throttling that can affect some competing devices.

## Camera System

The triple camera system, developed in collaboration with Hasselblad, continues to improve:

- 50MP main camera with Sony LYT-808 sensor and OIS
- 48MP ultrawide camera with 114° field of view
- 64MP 3x telephoto with OIS

Hasselblad's color tuning is evident in the natural, balanced color profile across different lighting conditions. Portrait mode benefits from enhanced computational photography to deliver realistic depth of field effects and accurate skin tones.

Video capabilities include 8K recording at 24fps, 4K at 60/30fps with Dolby Vision HDR support, and improved stabilization options. The Pro mode offers Hasselblad-inspired controls and RAW capture for photographers seeking more creative control.

## Battery Life

The 5400mAh silicon-carbon battery supports:

- 100W SUPERVOOC wired charging (full charge in about 30 minutes)
- 50W AIRVOOC wireless charging
- Reverse wireless charging for accessories

Battery life is excellent, typically lasting a full day of heavy use or up to two days with moderate use. The combination of large battery capacity, efficient display, and fast charging options creates one of the best battery experiences available in a flagship smartphone.

## Software

The OnePlus 12 runs Android 14 with OxygenOS 14, offering a relatively clean experience with thoughtful additions. OnePlus promises four years of Android updates and five years of security patches.

While OxygenOS has evolved to share more elements with ColorOS (from parent company OPPO), it maintains distinctive features like:

- Canvas Always-On Display, which creates line drawings from photos
- O-Haptics for precise vibration feedback
- Work-Life Balance for app and notification management
- Zen Mode for digital wellbeing

The software emphasizes smooth performance, with animations and transitions optimized to feel responsive and fluid.

## Verdict

The OnePlus 12 establishes itself as a well-rounded flagship that excels in display quality, performance, and battery experience. While the camera system may not quite reach the heights of the absolute best camera phones from Apple, Samsung, and Google, it delivers consistently good results across various scenarios.

For users seeking a premium Android experience without the highest price tags of competing flagships, the OnePlus 12 strikes an excellent balance of features and value. Its combination of top-tier specifications, fast charging, and refined software creates a compelling package that continues OnePlus's tradition of delivering "flagship killers," albeit at a higher price point than in its early years.

The main considerations for potential buyers will be the regional variations in IP rating and the continued evolution of OxygenOS away from its once-distinctive minimalist approach. Nevertheless, the OnePlus 12 delivers a premium experience that competes favorably with more expensive alternatives.
