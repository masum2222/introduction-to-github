# OPPO Find X7 Ultra: Photography Revolution with Dual Periscopes

The OPPO Find X7 Ultra pushes the boundaries of smartphone photography with an innovative quad-camera system featuring dual periscope telephoto lenses, making it the first smartphone to implement this technology.

## Design & Build Quality

The Find X7 Ultra boasts a premium design with a large circular camera module that dominates the upper portion of the rear panel. Available in Ocean Blue, Sepia Brown, and Space Black, the device features a vegan leather back that provides excellent grip and resists fingerprints while offering a premium tactile experience.

The device features an aluminum frame with IP68 water and dust resistance, ensuring durability despite its premium materials. The camera module's distinctive design, with its symmetrical quad-camera arrangement, gives the phone an instantly recognizable profile.

The overall construction feels solid and premium, though at 221g, it's relatively heavy compared to some competitors. The vegan leather finish helps mitigate the feeling of weight by providing secure grip.

## Display

The 6.82-inch LTPO AMOLED display with 3168 x 1440 resolution offers exceptional visual quality. With an adaptive refresh rate from 1Hz to 120Hz, it balances smoothness with power efficiency. The panel achieves a peak brightness of 4500 nits, making it one of the brightest displays available on any smartphone and ensuring excellent visibility in all lighting conditions.

The display supports 10-bit color depth, 100% DCI-P3 coverage, HDR10+, and is Dolby Vision certified. The slight curve along the edges helps minimize bezels while maintaining good touch rejection for accidental inputs.

## Performance

Powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, the Find X7 Ultra delivers top-tier performance for all tasks. The chipset is complemented by up to 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM and UFS 4.0 storage up to 1TB, ensuring smooth multitasking and quick app launches.

OPPO has implemented a sophisticated cooling system with a vapor chamber and graphite layers to manage thermals during intensive tasks. This helps maintain consistent performance during extended gaming sessions or when recording high-resolution video.

## Camera System

The camera system, developed in collaboration with Hasselblad, is the highlight of the Find X7 Ultra:

- 50MP main camera with a 1-inch Sony LYT-900 sensor and OIS
- 50MP ultrawide camera with 120° field of view
- 50MP 3x telephoto with floating lens design
- 50MP 6x periscope telephoto

The dual periscope design is unique in the smartphone industry, offering exceptional versatility for zoom photography. The 3x and 6x optical zoom lenses work together with computational photography to deliver high-quality results across a broad zoom range, from ultrawide to 120x digital zoom.

Hasselblad's color science is evident in the Natural Color Calibration, providing accurate and pleasing colors across different lighting conditions. Portrait mode benefits from the various focal lengths, particularly the 3x telephoto which is ideal for portrait photography.

Video capabilities include 8K recording at 24fps, 4K at 60fps with Dolby Vision HDR support, and advanced stabilization options.

## Battery Life

The 5000mAh battery supports:

- 100W SUPERVOOC wired charging (full charge in about 30 minutes)
- 50W AIRVOOC wireless charging
- 10W reverse wireless charging

Battery life is solid, typically lasting a full day of intensive use thanks to the efficient LTPO display technology and system optimizations. The fast charging options ensure minimal downtime when a recharge is needed.

## Software

The Find X7 Ultra runs Android 14 with OPPO's ColorOS 14, offering a feature-rich experience with extensive customization options. OPPO promises four years of Android updates and five years of security patches.

ColorOS includes productivity features like Multi-Screen Connect for PC integration, Smart Sidebar for quick access to frequently used apps, and advanced privacy controls. Hasselblad's influence extends to the camera app, with a Pro mode that emulates the interface and controls of Hasselblad cameras.

## Verdict

The OPPO Find X7 Ultra establishes itself as a photography powerhouse, with its dual periscope system offering unmatched versatility for zoom photography. The collaboration with Hasselblad delivers tangible benefits in color science and camera interface design.

Beyond photography, it excels as a premium flagship with top-tier performance, a stunning display, and fast charging capabilities. While its availability may be limited in some global markets and its price positions it in the ultra-premium segment, photography enthusiasts will find the innovative camera system worth the investment.

For those seeking the most versatile camera system in a smartphone, particularly for telephoto capabilities, the Find X7 Ultra sets a new standard with its dual periscope approach.
