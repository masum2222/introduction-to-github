# Google Pixel 8a: AI Features at a Mid-Range Price

The Google Pixel 8a continues Google's tradition of bringing flagship camera capabilities and software features to a more affordable price point, with this generation adding the same Tensor G3 chip found in the premium Pixel 8 models.

## Design & Build Quality

The Pixel 8a maintains the distinctive Pixel design language with the horizontal camera bar on the back, though with a more budget-friendly construction. Available in Obsidian, Porcelain, Bay, and Mint colors, the device features a plastic unibody design with a matte finish that feels comfortable in hand while resisting fingerprints.

While not as premium as the aluminum and glass construction of the Pixel 8, the Pixel 8a offers good build quality for its price segment. With IP67 water and dust resistance, it provides protection against splashes and brief immersion.

The device features slightly more rounded corners compared to previous A-series Pixels, matching the design aesthetic of the mainline Pixel 8. The front is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3, which provides decent scratch resistance though falls short of the Gorilla Glass Victus found on more expensive models.

## Display

The 6.1-inch OLED display offers a resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels and now includes a 120Hz refresh rate, an upgrade from the 90Hz of the previous generation. With 1400 nits of peak brightness (2000 nits in HDR content), the display performs admirably in outdoor conditions.

Color accuracy is excellent, with full DCI-P3 coverage and good viewing angles. The higher refresh rate contributes to a smoother scrolling experience and better responsiveness, making the Pixel 8a feel more premium than its price suggests.

## Performance

Powered by the same Google Tensor G3 processor found in the flagship Pixel 8 models, the Pixel 8a delivers impressive performance, particularly for AI and computational photography tasks. Paired with 8GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of storage, the device handles everyday tasks smoothly.

While not quite matching the raw benchmark scores of top-tier Snapdragon or Apple chips, the Tensor G3 excels at the machine learning tasks that power many of Google's signature features. Some thermal throttling may occur during extended gaming sessions, but for typical usage, performance remains consistent.

## Camera System

The camera system includes:

- 64MP main camera with OIS and larger sensor than the Pixel 7a
- 13MP ultrawide camera with 120° field of view
- 13MP front camera with autofocus

Google's computational photography continues to shine, with the Pixel 8a producing impressive photos in various lighting conditions. Night Sight delivers exceptional low-light photography, while the improved ultrawide camera captures more detail than its predecessor.

New AI-powered features include:

- Magic Editor for advanced photo manipulation
- Best Take for combining faces from multiple group shots
- Audio Magic Eraser for reducing background noise in videos

Video capabilities include 4K recording at 60fps from both front and rear cameras, with good stabilization and dynamic range.

## Software & AI Features

The Pixel 8a ships with Android 14 and Google's commitment to seven years of OS updates and security patches, matching the premium Pixel 8 models in software longevity.

AI features are the highlight, including:

- Circle to Search: Identifying objects or text in any app by circling them
- Call Screen and Call Assist: Screening calls and providing real-time transcription
- Live Translate: Real-time translation in messaging apps and phone calls
- Gemini AI integration for various tasks and queries

These features make the Pixel 8a stand out in the mid-range segment, offering capabilities typically reserved for more expensive devices.

## Battery Life

The 4500mAh battery typically provides a full day of moderate use, though heavy users might need a top-up before the day ends. Charging options include:

- 18W wired charging (reaching about 50% in 30 minutes)
- 15W wireless charging (a rarity in this price segment)

While the charging speeds fall behind many competitors, the inclusion of wireless charging adds convenience not often found at this price point.

## Verdict

The Pixel 8a represents an excellent value, offering the same processor, many of the same AI features, and similar camera capabilities as the flagship Pixel 8 at a significantly lower price point. The addition of a 120Hz display and wireless charging addresses previous pain points in the A-series.

For users who prioritize camera quality, clean software, and AI features without paying flagship prices, the Pixel 8a is a compelling option. The seven-year update promise also means the phone should remain relevant far longer than most mid-range alternatives.

The main compromises come in build quality, charging speed, and storage options, but these are reasonable trade-offs given the substantial savings compared to the standard Pixel 8. For most users, the Pixel 8a represents the sweet spot in Google's lineup, delivering the essential Pixel experience without unnecessary premium materials or features.
