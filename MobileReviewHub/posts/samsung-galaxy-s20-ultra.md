# Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra: The First Ultra Experience

The Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra represented Samsung's first foray into the "Ultra" premium segment, pushing the boundaries of smartphone technology with its groundbreaking camera system, massive display, and top-tier specifications. As the most ambitious member of the S20 family, it aimed to deliver the ultimate Android experience with no compromises.

## Design & Build Quality

The Galaxy S20 Ultra features a massive, imposing design that clearly communicates its flagship status. Available in Cosmic Black and Cosmic Gray, the device sports a premium glass and metal construction that feels solid and substantial in the hand.

With dimensions of 166.9 x 76 x 8.8mm and weighing a hefty 220g, the S20 Ultra is one of the largest and heaviest mainstream smartphones of its time. The weight distribution is reasonable, but the sheer size makes one-handed operation challenging for most users.

The massive rectangular camera bump on the rear is a distinctive design element that protrudes significantly from the back glass, making the phone wobble when placed on flat surfaces without a case. While functionally necessary to house the complex camera system, it's not the most elegant solution aesthetically.

The build quality is excellent with an aluminum frame and Corning Gorilla Glass 6 protection on both front and back. The IP68 water and dust resistance rating ensures durability in various environments.

## Display

The 6.9-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display is a standout feature, offering:

- QHD+ resolution (3200 x 1440 pixels) at 511 ppi
- 120Hz refresh rate (though only available when resolution is set to FHD+)
- HDR10+ certification
- Excellent color accuracy and brightness
- Reduced blue light emission

The high refresh rate provides a noticeably smoother experience when scrolling and navigating the UI, though the limitation requiring users to choose between maximum resolution or high refresh rate was disappointing at this price point.

The display features curved edges that enhance the premium feel while occasionally leading to accidental touches. Overall, the display quality is excellent, with deep blacks, vibrant colors, and good visibility even in bright outdoor conditions.

## Performance

Powered by either the Snapdragon 865 (in North America and China) or the Exynos 990 (in Europe and other regions), the S20 Ultra delivers flagship-level performance for all tasks. However, the performance disparity between the two variants was particularly notable in this generation, with the Exynos version suffering from inferior performance, efficiency, and thermal management.

With 12GB or 16GB of RAM and storage options up to 512GB (plus microSD expansion), the device provides ample resources for multitasking and storage. Real-world performance is excellent, particularly on the Snapdragon variant, with smooth UI navigation, quick app launching, and powerful gaming capabilities.

## Camera System

The camera system was the most hyped aspect of the S20 Ultra, featuring:

- A groundbreaking 108MP main camera with a large sensor
- 12MP ultrawide camera with a 120° field of view
- 48MP periscope telephoto with 4x optical zoom and up to 100x digital zoom (marketed as "Space Zoom")
- Time-of-Flight depth sensor for improved portrait effects
- 40MP front camera for detailed selfies

While the hardware specifications were impressive, the camera experience at launch was marred by autofocus issues with the main sensor, which Samsung attempted to address through software updates. When working correctly, the camera system could produce excellent results in good lighting, with the main sensor capturing impressive detail and dynamic range.

The much-advertised 100x Space Zoom, while technically impressive, produced results that were rarely usable beyond marketing demonstrations. However, zoom quality at lower magnifications (10-30x) was quite good for a smartphone of its time.

Video capabilities include 8K recording at 24fps, though with significant crop and limited practical utility, and excellent 4K recording at up to 60fps with improved stabilization.

## Software & Features

The Galaxy S20 Ultra shipped with Android 10 and One UI 2.1, offering:

- Refined interface with improved one-handed usability
- Enhanced Dark Mode
- Improved camera software with new features like Single Take
- DeX support for a desktop-like experience
- Integration with Microsoft services
- Enhanced Bixby functionality

Samsung promised three years of major Android updates, though the actual delivery speed of these updates often lagged behind competitors like Google and OnePlus.

## Battery Life

The 5000mAh battery is appropriately sized for the device's large display and powerful components, typically providing a full day of use for most users. However, enabling the 120Hz refresh rate significantly impacts battery life, as does using 5G connectivity extensively.

Power efficiency varies notably between the Snapdragon and Exynos variants, with the latter typically offering worse battery life under similar conditions.

Charging capabilities include:

- 45W wired fast charging (though a 25W charger is included in the box)
- 15W wireless charging
- 4.5W reverse wireless charging for accessories

## 5G Connectivity

As one of Samsung's first mainstream 5G devices, the S20 Ultra supports both sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G networks (in compatible variants), offering next-generation connectivity where available. However, in 2020, 5G coverage remained limited in most regions, and the technology significantly impacted battery life when active.

## Additional Features

Other notable features include:

- Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor (though less reliable than optical alternatives at the time)
- Stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support
- Wi-Fi 6 support for enhanced wireless connectivity
- Samsung Pay with MST technology
- Wireless DeX functionality

## Verdict

The Galaxy S20 Ultra represented Samsung's first attempt at creating an ultra-premium tier in its flagship lineup, and while ambitious, it suffered from several first-generation issues. The camera system, while impressive on paper, needed software refinement, and the choice between high refresh rate or high resolution seemed unnecessary at this price point.

The regional disparity between Snapdragon and Exynos variants was particularly problematic for this model, with many users in Exynos regions feeling short-changed by the inferior performance and efficiency.

Despite these shortcomings, the S20 Ultra pushed the boundaries of smartphone technology and established the foundation for the Ultra line that would see significant refinement in subsequent generations. For early adopters willing to pay the premium price and tolerate some rough edges, it offered cutting-edge capabilities and technology that pointed toward the future of mobile devices.
