# Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra: Setting New Standards

The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra represented a significant refinement of Samsung's ultra-premium smartphone concept, addressing most of the shortcomings of its predecessor while introducing several innovative features including S Pen support and an advanced quad camera system with dual telephoto lenses.

## Design & Build Quality

The Galaxy S21 Ultra features a bold design with a massive camera module that flows elegantly into the frame, creating what Samsung calls the "Contour Cut Camera" design. Available in Phantom Black, Phantom Silver, Phantom Titanium, Phantom Navy, and Phantom Brown, the device offers a sophisticated aesthetic with a matte finish that resists fingerprints.

With dimensions of 165.1 x 75.6 x 8.9mm and weighing 227g, the S21 Ultra is a large, substantial device that's clearly designed for power users rather than those seeking compact convenience. The weight distribution is good, but one-handed operation remains challenging due to its size.

The build quality is exceptional with an aluminum frame and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus protection on both front and back, offering improved drop and scratch resistance. The IP68 water and dust resistance rating ensures durability in various environments.

## Display

The 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display is among the best ever put in a smartphone, with several key improvements over the S20 Ultra:

- QHD+ resolution (3200 x 1440 pixels) at 515 ppi
- Adaptive refresh rate that scales from the 10Hz to 120Hz depending on content, even at full resolution
- Peak brightness of 1500 nits for exceptional outdoor visibility
- HDR10+ certification and 100% DCI-P3 color gamut coverage

The display offers excellent color accuracy, contrast, and viewing angles. The subtle curvature on the long edges enhances the premium feel while being less pronounced than previous generations, reducing accidental touches.

## Performance

Powered by either the Snapdragon 888 (in North America and China) or the Exynos 2100 (in Europe and other regions), the S21 Ultra delivers flagship-level performance for all tasks. While the Snapdragon variant generally outperforms the Exynos in both processing power and efficiency, both versions handle demanding applications with ease.

With configurations offering 12GB or 16GB of RAM and storage options from 128GB to 512GB, the device provides ample resources for multitasking and storage. However, the removal of microSD card support represents a significant departure from previous Galaxy S devices.

## Camera System

The versatile quad camera system is a highlight feature and includes:

- An improved 108MP main camera with a larger sensor and better low-light performance
- 12MP ultrawide camera with a 120° field of view
- 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom
- 10MP periscope telephoto with 10x optical zoom
- 40MP front camera with phase detection autofocus

The introduction of dual telephoto cameras provides exceptional zoom flexibility, with good quality up to 10x optical zoom and reasonable results with digital zoom beyond that. The camera system excels in various lighting conditions, with improved computational photography algorithms enhancing detail, color accuracy, and dynamic range.

Video capabilities include 8K recording at 24fps, 4K at up to 60fps with improved stabilization, and features like Director's View and Single Take.

## S Pen Support

For the first time in the S series, the Galaxy S21 Ultra offers S Pen support, bringing the signature feature of the Note series to a wider audience. The S Pen can be purchased separately, either standalone or as part of a case that includes storage for the stylus.

While the S21 Ultra's S Pen lacks the Bluetooth functionality of the Note series' stylus, it provides the core writing, drawing, and navigation features with 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity. This expands the device's utility for productivity and creativity tasks, though the lack of built-in storage is a notable compromise compared to the Note series.

## Software & Features

The Galaxy S21 Ultra ships with Android 11 and One UI 3.1, offering:

- Refined interface with improved one-handed usability
- Enhanced privacy features
- Improved camera software with new modes and features
- DeX wireless support for a desktop-like experience
- Integration with Microsoft services
- Enhanced SmartThings ecosystem support

Samsung promises three years of major Android updates and four years of security patches, ensuring the device will remain current with features and security protections.

## Battery Life

The 5000mAh battery typically provides a full day of use for most users, though heavy camera use, gaming, or using the display at maximum resolution and refresh rate can reduce this. Power efficiency varies between the Snapdragon and Exynos variants, with the former typically offering better battery life.

Charging capabilities include:

- 25W wired fast charging
- 15W wireless charging
- 4.5W reverse wireless charging for accessories

Controversially, Samsung removed the charger from the box, following Apple's lead with the iPhone 12 series, providing only a USB-C cable.

## Additional Features

Other notable features include:

- Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor with a 77% larger recognition area for improved reliability
- Stereo speakers tuned by AKG with Dolby Atmos support
- UWB (Ultra-Wideband) for precise spatial awareness and features like digital key
- Wi-Fi 6E support for enhanced wireless connectivity
- Improved 5G compatibility with both sub-6GHz and mmWave support (in supported regions)

## Verdict

The Galaxy S21 Ultra represents a significant refinement over its predecessor, addressing most of the S20 Ultra's shortcomings while introducing new features like S Pen support and dual telephoto cameras. The exceptional display, versatile camera system, and powerful performance create a compelling package for power users.

While the high price point, removal of microSD support, and lack of included charger are notable compromises, the S21 Ultra delivers one of the most complete and capable smartphone experiences available at its launch. It particularly excels for photography enthusiasts, content creators, and productivity-focused users who can benefit from the S Pen functionality.

The Galaxy S21 Ultra set a new standard for ultra-premium smartphones, combining cutting-edge hardware with refined software and exceptional versatility.
