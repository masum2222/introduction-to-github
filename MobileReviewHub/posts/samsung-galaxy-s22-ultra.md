# Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra: The Return of the Note

The Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra represents a significant milestone in Samsung's smartphone evolution, effectively merging the Galaxy Note series with the S series to create an ultra-premium device that combines the best aspects of both lineups.

## Design & Build Quality

The Galaxy S22 Ultra departs from the design language of the regular S22 models, featuring a boxy, rectangular shape with squared-off corners reminiscent of the Note series. Available in Phantom Black, Phantom White, Burgundy, and Green (with additional online-exclusive colors), the device offers a sophisticated, professional aesthetic.

With dimensions of 163.3 x 77.9 x 8.9mm and weighing 228g, the S22 Ultra is a large, substantial device that's clearly designed for power users rather than those seeking compact convenience. The weight distribution is well-balanced, though one-handed operation can be challenging due to its size.

The build quality is exceptional with Armor Aluminum frame and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus+ protection on both front and back, offering improved drop and scratch resistance. The IP68 water and dust resistance rating ensures durability in various environments.

The integration of the S Pen within the device body is the standout design feature, with a silo located at the bottom left of the frame that allows the stylus to be stored and charged. This officially completes the absorption of the Note series into the S series lineup.

## Display

The 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display is among the best panels on the market with:

- QHD+ resolution (3088 x 1440 pixels) at 500 ppi
- Adaptive refresh rate from 1Hz to 120Hz
- Peak brightness of 1750 nits for exceptional outdoor visibility
- HDR10+ certification and 100% DCI-P3 color gamut coverage
- Vision booster technology that enhances visibility in bright sunlight

The display offers excellent color accuracy, contrast, and viewing angles. The subtle curvature on the long edges enhances the premium feel while being less pronounced than previous generations, reducing accidental touches.

## Performance

Powered by either the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 (in North America and some Asian markets) or the Exynos 2200 (in Europe and other regions), the S22 Ultra delivers flagship-level performance for all tasks. While the Snapdragon variant generally outperforms the Exynos in both processing power and efficiency, both versions handle demanding applications with ease.

With configurations offering 8GB or 12GB of RAM and storage options from 128GB to 1TB, the device provides ample resources for multitasking and storage. The vapor chamber cooling system helps manage thermals during extended high-load tasks, though the device can still become warm during gaming or intensive camera use.

## S Pen Functionality

The integrated S Pen is a defining feature, offering 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity and reduced latency of just 2.8ms (down from 9ms on the Note 20 Ultra). This results in a more natural writing and drawing experience that closely approximates using pen on paper.

S Pen features include:

- Air Commands for quick access to frequently used functions
- Screen off memo for taking quick notes without unlocking the device
- Samsung Notes with improved handwriting recognition
- Air Actions for remote control of various apps
- Precision selection and screenshot annotation

For productivity-focused users, the S Pen transforms the device into a digital notebook, document annotation tool, and precision input device that few competing flagship phones can match.

## Camera System

The versatile quad camera system includes:

- A 108MP main camera with an improved sensor compared to the S21 Ultra
- 12MP ultrawide camera with a 120° field of view
- 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom
- 10MP periscope telephoto with 10x optical zoom
- 40MP front camera with phase detection autofocus

The camera system excels in various lighting conditions, with improved computational photography algorithms enhancing detail, color accuracy, and dynamic range. The dual telephoto cameras provide exceptional zoom flexibility, with good quality up to 10x optical zoom and reasonable results with digital zoom beyond that.

Video capabilities include 8K recording at 24fps, 4K at up to 60fps with improved stabilization, and features like Director's View and Portrait Video mode.

## Software & Updates

The Galaxy S22 Ultra ships with Android 12 and One UI 4.1, offering:

- Material You design language with personalized color palettes
- Enhanced privacy features including indicators when camera or microphone is in use
- Improved Samsung ecosystem integration
- Knox security platform for data protection
- Expanded DeX functionality for desktop-like experiences

Samsung promises four years of major Android updates and five years of security patches, ensuring the device will remain current with features and security protections until at least 2027.

## Battery Life

The 5000mAh battery typically provides a full day of use for most users, though heavy use of the S Pen, camera, or gaming can reduce this. Power efficiency varies between the Snapdragon and Exynos variants, with the former typically offering better battery life.

Charging capabilities include:

- 45W wired fast charging (reaching about a 50% charge in 20 minutes)
- 15W wireless charging
- 4.5W reverse wireless charging for accessories

While the charging speeds fall behind some competitors, they provide a good balance between charging time and battery longevity.

## Additional Features

Other notable features include:

- Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor for fast and reliable unlocking
- Stereo speakers tuned by AKG with Dolby Atmos support
- Ultra-wideband (UWB) support for precise spatial awareness
- Samsung DeX for a desktop-like experience when connected to a display
- Expanded Samsung ecosystem integration with Galaxy Watch, Buds, and laptops

## Verdict

The Galaxy S22 Ultra successfully bridges the gap between the S and Note series, delivering a premium device that caters to power users seeking maximum productivity and creativity tools. The integration of the S Pen, versatile camera system, and top-tier display create a compelling package that stands apart from other flagship smartphones.

While the high price point, large size, and regional processor disparities are notable considerations, the S22 Ultra provides an unmatched feature set for those who can utilize its capabilities. It's particularly appealing to former Note users and professionals who value the productivity enhancements of the S Pen.

The Galaxy S22 Ultra represents Samsung's most complete smartphone to date at its launch, combining cutting-edge hardware with refined software and the unique advantage of integrated stylus functionality.
