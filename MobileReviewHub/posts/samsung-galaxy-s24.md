# Samsung Galaxy S24: Compact Flagship with AI Focus

The Samsung Galaxy S24 represents the entry point to Samsung's 2024 flagship lineup, bringing Galaxy AI features and improved performance to a compact form factor that appeals to users who prefer one-handed operation without compromising on capabilities.

## Design & Build Quality

The Galaxy S24 maintains a similar design language to its predecessor but with subtle refinements. The aluminum frame has been strengthened and features a slightly flatter design, while the front and back remain protected by Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2. Available in Onyx Black, Marble Gray, Cobalt Violet, and Amber Yellow, the device offers a premium look and feel.

With dimensions of 147 x 70.6 x 7.6mm, the Galaxy S24 is slightly smaller than the S23 while maintaining the same screen size, thanks to reduced bezels. The weight of 167g makes it one of the more comfortable flagships to use one-handed. The device maintains IP68 water and dust resistance, ensuring durability in various conditions.

The overall construction feels solid and premium, with excellent build quality that has become a hallmark of Samsung's flagship devices.

## Display

The 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display has been improved with higher peak brightness, reaching 2600 nits for exceptional outdoor visibility. The resolution remains at 2340 x 1080 pixels (Full HD+), which provides a good balance of sharpness and power efficiency.

The adaptive refresh rate technology scales from 1Hz to 120Hz depending on on-screen content, helping extend battery life while maintaining smooth scrolling and animations. The panel offers excellent color accuracy with 100% DCI-P3 coverage and HDR10+ certification for vibrant, lifelike colors.

With reduced bezels all around, the screen-to-body ratio has improved, creating a more immersive viewing experience without increasing the physical size of the device.

## Performance

The Galaxy S24 is powered by the Exynos 2400 chipset in most global markets, while North American versions receive the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy. Both processors offer significant performance improvements over their predecessors, though some performance differences exist between the two variants.

With 8GB of RAM and storage options ranging from 128GB to 512GB, the device handles multitasking and demanding applications with ease. Samsung has improved the vapor chamber cooling system, allowing for better sustained performance during intensive tasks like gaming.

Real-world performance is excellent, with smooth UI navigation, quick app launching, and responsive gaming experiences. The AI capabilities of both chipsets power the new Galaxy AI features that are central to the S24 series.

## Galaxy AI Features

The Galaxy AI suite includes several innovative tools:

- Live Translate: Real-time translation during phone calls
- Circle to Search with Google: Instant search by circling anything on screen
- Chat Assist: Tone suggestions and translations for messaging
- Note Assist: Transcription, summaries, and formatting for Samsung Notes
- Photo Assist: AI-powered editing tools including object removal and recomposition
- Transcript Assist: Voice recording with transcription and summary capabilities

These features set the Galaxy S24 apart from many competitors, making it one of the most AI-capable phones available. Samsung promises to keep these features updated and to add new capabilities over time.

## Camera System

The camera system includes:

- 50MP main camera with OIS and improved night mode
- 12MP ultrawide camera with 120° field of view
- 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom and OIS
- 12MP front camera with improved low-light capabilities

While the hardware specifications are similar to the S23, Samsung has implemented improved computational photography algorithms that deliver better detail, dynamic range, and low-light performance. The ProVisual Engine enhances image processing, particularly in challenging lighting conditions.

Video capabilities include 8K recording at 30fps, 4K at 60fps with improved stabilization, and enhanced slow-motion options. The Portrait Video feature now offers better subject separation and bokeh effects.

## Software & Updates

The Galaxy S24 ships with Android 14 and One UI 6.1, Samsung's refined interface that balances feature richness with user-friendly design. Samsung has committed to seven years of OS updates and security patches, matching Google's Pixel devices for the longest support period in the Android ecosystem.

The extended software support significantly improves the long-term value proposition of the device, ensuring it will remain current with features and security protections until 2031.

## Battery Life

The 4000mAh battery typically provides a full day of use for most users, with improvements in efficiency from both the display and processor contributing to reliable battery life despite the compact size.

Charging capabilities include:

- 25W wired fast charging (reaching about 50% in 30 minutes)
- 15W wireless charging
- 4.5W reverse wireless charging for accessories

While these charging speeds fall behind some competitors, they provide a balance between convenience and battery longevity.

## Verdict

The Galaxy S24 successfully delivers the core flagship experience in a compact, hand-friendly package. While not offering all the premium features of the Ultra model, it provides an excellent balance of performance, camera capabilities, and display quality at a more accessible price point.

The addition of Galaxy AI features significantly enhances the user experience, with practical tools that go beyond novelty to provide genuine utility. The seven-year update promise also ensures the phone will remain relevant far longer than most competitors.

For users who prefer a smaller device without major compromises, the Galaxy S24 represents one of the best compact flagships available. The main considerations for potential buyers will be the regional processor differences and the relatively modest charging speeds compared to some rivals.
