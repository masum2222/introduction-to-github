# Samsung Galaxy Z Fold5: Refined Foldable Experience

The Galaxy Z Fold5 represents Samsung's continued refinement of the foldable smartphone concept, now in its fifth generation with improvements focusing on practical usability and durability.

## Design & Build Quality

The Z Fold5 features Samsung's most refined foldable design to date, with the new "Flex Hinge" allowing the device to close completely flat without the gap seen in previous generations. This improvement not only creates a more seamless appearance when closed but also enhances durability by reducing the potential for debris to enter the hinge mechanism.

At 13.4mm when folded (down from 14.2mm in the Z Fold4) and weighing 253g (10g lighter than its predecessor), the Z Fold5 shows incremental improvement in portability, though it remains substantially thicker than conventional smartphones when folded.

Available in Icy Blue, Phantom Black, and Cream color options, the device maintains Samsung's premium build quality with Armor Aluminum frame and Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the cover display and rear panel. The IPX8 water resistance rating provides protection against water immersion up to 1.5 meters for 30 minutes, though there's no dust resistance rating.

## Display

The Z Fold5 features two displays:

- 7.6-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X main display (2176 x 1812, 1-120Hz adaptive)
- 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X cover display (2316 x 904, 48-120Hz adaptive)

Both displays offer excellent color accuracy, brightness, and viewing angles, with peak brightness reaching 1750 nits for improved outdoor visibility. The main display features an improved screen protector that's 20% more resistant to scratches, addressing a pain point from earlier models.

The crease where the display folds remains visible, though it's less pronounced than in earlier generations and becomes less noticeable during active use. The ultra-thin glass (UTG) technology continues to improve in durability while maintaining flexibility.

## Performance

Powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy (a slightly overclocked version of Qualcomm's flagship chip), the Z Fold5 delivers excellent performance for all tasks. With 12GB of RAM standard across all storage configurations (256GB/512GB/1TB), the device excels at multitasking—a key use case for foldable devices.

Samsung has improved the vapor chamber cooling system, allowing for better sustained performance during intensive tasks like gaming or using multiple apps simultaneously on the main display. Benchmark results consistently place it among the fastest Android devices available.

## Foldable Experience & Software

The Z Fold5 runs Android 13 with One UI 5.1.1, featuring numerous optimizations for the foldable form factor:

- Taskbar: A persistent or auto-hiding dock that enhances multitasking
- Flex Mode: Special interfaces when the device is partially folded
- App Continuity: Seamless transition between displays when opening/closing the device
- Multi-Window: Run up to three apps simultaneously with customizable layouts
- S Pen support: Compatible with the S Pen Fold Edition, though there's no built-in storage

Samsung DeX provides a desktop-like experience when connected to an external display, leveraging the powerful internals to create a productivity-focused computing environment.

Samsung promises four years of OS updates and five years of security patches, ensuring the Z Fold5 will remain current with software features and security protections for years to come.

## Camera System

The camera system includes:

- 50MP main camera with OIS (f/1.8)
- 12MP ultrawide (f/2.2, 123° FoV)
- 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom and OIS (f/2.4)
- 4MP under-display camera on main screen
- 10MP cover display camera

Photo quality from the rear cameras is excellent, comparable to the Galaxy S23+, with good detail, dynamic range, and low-light performance. The telephoto camera delivers sharp images up to 3x zoom, with decent quality at higher digital zoom levels.

The under-display camera remains a weak point, with noticeable quality compromises compared to traditional front-facing cameras. It's adequate for video calls but not ideal for critical photography. Most users will prefer the higher quality cover display camera for selfies.

## Battery Life

The 4400mAh battery typically provides a full day of mixed use, though heavy use of the main display will drain the battery faster. Charging options include:

- 25W wired charging (reaching about a 50% charge in 30 minutes)
- 15W wireless charging
- 4.5W reverse wireless charging

The charging speeds remain relatively conservative compared to many Android competitors, though this approach may benefit long-term battery health.

## Verdict

The Galaxy Z Fold5 represents an incremental but meaningful refinement of Samsung's foldable flagship. The improved hinge design, reduced weight, and enhanced performance address several pain points from previous generations, while maintaining the strengths that have made the Z Fold series the benchmark for book-style foldables.

For power users and multitasking enthusiasts, the Z Fold5 offers a unique combination of tablet-like screen real estate in a (relatively) pocket-friendly device. The premium price remains a significant barrier to widespread adoption, but for those who can justify the investment, the Z Fold5 delivers a versatile and increasingly polished experience that bridges the gap between smartphone and tablet.

While not a revolutionary upgrade from the Z Fold4, existing Z Fold owners from generations 3 or earlier will find substantial improvements in the overall experience, particularly in hinge design, display durability, and performance.
