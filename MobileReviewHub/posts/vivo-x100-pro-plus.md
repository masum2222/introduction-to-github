# Vivo X100 Pro+: Camera Powerhouse with No Compromises

The Vivo X100 Pro+ represents the pinnacle of Vivo's smartphone technology, with a particular focus on pushing the boundaries of mobile photography through its partnership with ZEISS and the integration of top-tier hardware components.

## Design & Build Quality

The X100 Pro+ features a premium design with a subtle curved display and a prominent circular camera module that dominates the upper portion of the rear panel. Available in Black and White options, the device features a vegan leather back that provides excellent grip while resisting fingerprints and scratches.

The aluminum frame and vegan leather back combine to create a device that feels premium and substantial. At 225g, it's relatively heavy but distributes weight well for comfortable handling. The overall dimensions maintain a good balance between screen size and manageability.

The camera module's distinctive design, with its symmetrical arrangement and ZEISS branding, announces the phone's photography prowess and contributes to its unique identity. The device carries an IP68 rating for water and dust resistance, ensuring durability despite its premium materials.

## Display

The 6.78-inch LTPO AMOLED display offers a resolution of 2800 x 1260 pixels with an adaptive refresh rate from 1Hz to 120Hz. With a peak brightness of 3000 nits, it excels in outdoor visibility while providing deep blacks and vibrant colors in all lighting conditions.

The display supports 10-bit color depth, HDR10+, and covers 100% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, making it ideal for media consumption. The panel's subtle curves help minimize bezels while maintaining good touch rejection algorithms to prevent accidental inputs.

## Performance

Powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, the X100 Pro+ delivers top-tier performance for all tasks. The chipset is paired with 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM and UFS 4.0 storage options of 512GB or 1TB, ensuring ample resources for even the most demanding applications and multitasking scenarios.

Vivo has implemented an advanced cooling system with a large vapor chamber and multiple layers of graphite sheets to manage thermals effectively. This helps maintain sustained performance during intensive tasks like gaming or 4K video recording with minimal throttling.

## Camera System

The camera system, developed in collaboration with ZEISS, is the standout feature of the X100 Pro+:

- 50MP main camera with a 1-inch Sony IMX989 sensor, ZEISS T* coating, and OIS
- 50MP portrait camera with 2x optical zoom and ZEISS Biotar simulation
- 50MP ultrawide camera with 114° field of view
- 200MP periscope telephoto with 4.3x optical zoom and up to 100x digital zoom

The 1-inch main sensor delivers exceptional light gathering capabilities and dynamic range, particularly in challenging lighting conditions. The 200MP periscope telephoto is a highlight, offering unprecedented detail in zoom photography for a smartphone.

ZEISS's contribution extends to both hardware and software, with high-quality lens coatings that reduce flare and ghosting, plus portrait modes that simulate classic ZEISS lenses like Biotar, Sonnar, and Distagon, each with characteristic bokeh patterns.

Video capabilities include 8K recording at 30fps, 4K at 60fps with enhanced stabilization, and ZEISS-tuned cinematic modes that offer professional-looking results with minimal effort.

## Battery Life

The 5500mAh silicon-carbon battery provides exceptional longevity, typically lasting more than a day of heavy use or up to two days with moderate usage. Charging options include:

- 100W FlashCharge wired charging (full charge in about 30 minutes)
- 50W wireless charging
- 10W reverse wireless charging for accessories

The combination of large battery capacity and rapid charging creates a worry-free user experience, eliminating battery anxiety even for power users.

## Software

The X100 Pro+ runs Android 14 with OriginOS 4 in China or FunTouch OS 14 in global markets. Both interfaces offer extensive customization options and additional features on top of stock Android.

Vivo promises three years of Android updates and four years of security patches, which, while respectable, falls short of the longer update commitments now offered by Samsung and Google.

The software includes several AI-enhanced features, particularly for photography, such as AI Portrait, AI Eraser, and advanced scene recognition that optimizes camera settings based on what you're shooting.

## Additional Features

Other notable features include:

- Stereo speakers with Hi-Res audio certification
- Dual-frequency GPS for precise location tracking
- Advanced haptic feedback for improved tactile response
- Dedicated V2 imaging chip for enhanced computational photography
- IR blaster for controlling home appliances

## Verdict

The Vivo X100 Pro+ establishes itself as one of the most capable camera phones available, with its ZEISS partnership delivering tangible benefits for photography enthusiasts. The combination of the 1-inch main sensor, high-resolution periscope zoom, and advanced computational photography creates a versatile camera system capable of exceptional results in various conditions.

Beyond photography, it excels as a premium flagship with top-tier performance, a stunning display, and excellent battery life. While its premium price and limited global availability may restrict its appeal, and its update commitment doesn't match some competitors, photography enthusiasts who can obtain it will find it delivers one of the most complete smartphone experiences available.

For those who prioritize camera capabilities above all else and are willing to pay a premium price, the X100 Pro+ represents Vivo's most accomplished flagship to date, challenging and in some aspects surpassing offerings from more established premium brands.
