# Vivo X100 Pro: Redefining Mobile Photography

The Vivo X100 Pro represents a significant achievement in smartphone photography, combining powerful hardware with advanced computational photography techniques developed in collaboration with ZEISS.

## Design & Build Quality

The X100 Pro features a premium design with a curved-edge display and a distinctive circular camera module on the rear. Available in Asteroid Black and Titanium Gray, the device offers a sophisticated aesthetic that stands out from typical smartphone designs.

The back panel uses a frosted glass finish that resists fingerprints while providing a premium feel. The prominent circular camera island houses the triple-camera system and features the ZEISS branding, highlighting the photography focus of this device.

With IP68 water and dust resistance, the X100 Pro offers peace of mind against accidental splashes and dust exposure. At 225g, it's relatively heavy, but the weight distribution helps maintain comfort during extended use.

## Display

The 6.78-inch curved AMOLED display offers a resolution of 2800 x 1260 pixels with a 120Hz refresh rate and 300Hz touch sampling rate. The 1.5K resolution balances sharpness with power efficiency, while the panel supports 100% DCI-P3 color gamut coverage and HDR10+ certification.

With a peak brightness of 3000 nits, the display remains clearly visible even in direct sunlight. The curved edges create an immersive viewing experience, though some users may prefer flat displays for practical reasons.

## Performance

The X100 Pro is powered by MediaTek's flagship Dimensity 9300 chipset, the first to use four Cortex-X4 performance cores without any efficiency cores. This all-big-core design delivers exceptional performance for demanding tasks, though with potential implications for power efficiency.

Paired with up to 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM and UFS 4.0 storage up to 512GB, the device handles multitasking and app switching with ease. Vivo has implemented a large vapor chamber cooling system to manage thermals during intensive gaming sessions or video recording.

## Camera System

The camera system, co-engineered with ZEISS, is the standout feature of the X100 Pro:

- 50MP main camera with a 1-inch Sony IMX989 sensor and ZEISS T* coating
- 50MP portrait camera with 2x optical zoom and ZEISS Biotar simulation
- 50MP periscope telephoto with 3.5x optical zoom and up to 100x digital zoom

The 1-inch main sensor captures exceptional detail and performs remarkably well in low-light conditions. The V2 imaging chip developed by Vivo assists with computational photography, enabling features like 100x digital zoom and AI-enhanced night mode.

ZEISS's contribution includes optical lens coatings that reduce flare and ghosting, along with portrait modes that simulate classic ZEISS lenses like Biotar, Sonnar, and Distagon, each with characteristic bokeh patterns.

Video capabilities include 8K recording at 30fps and 4K at 60fps with enhanced stabilization through Vivo's Ultra Stabilization technology. The Cinematic Video mode offers manual controls and professional color profiles for content creators.

## Battery Life

The 5400mAh silicon-carbon battery provides excellent longevity, typically lasting more than a day of medium to heavy use. Charging options include:

- 100W FlashCharge wired charging (full charge in about 30 minutes)
- 50W wireless charging
- 10W reverse wireless charging

The silicon-carbon battery technology allows for higher capacity in the same physical space while maintaining good charging cycles for long-term reliability.

## Software

The X100 Pro runs Android 14 with Vivo's FunTouch OS 14 in global markets (or OriginOS 4 in China). The interface offers extensive customization options while maintaining good performance.

Vivo promises three years of Android updates and four years of security patches. The software includes several AI-enhanced features, particularly for photography, such as AI Portrait, AI Eraser, and advanced scene recognition.

## Verdict

The Vivo X100 Pro establishes itself as one of the premier camera phones on the market, with its ZEISS partnership delivering tangible benefits for photography enthusiasts. The combination of the 1-inch main sensor, versatile telephoto options, and advanced computational photography creates a versatile camera system capable of exceptional results in various conditions.

Beyond photography, it stands as a well-rounded flagship with strong performance, fast charging, and a quality display. While it faces stiff competition from established brands like Samsung and Apple, photography enthusiasts willing to explore beyond the most mainstream options will find the X100 Pro a compelling alternative that excels in image quality.
